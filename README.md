## End-to-End Workflow Roadmap

### **1. Input â†’ Symbolic Representation**

* Start with an audio fragment from the user.
* Transform it into a structured musical form (notes/chords/timings).
* This symbolic version becomes the canvas for further creativity.

---

### **2. Generative Model â†’ Musical Completion**

* Feed the symbolic input into a pretrained generative model.
* The system extends, harmonizes, or completes the fragment while keeping musical context.
* Output is a new, enriched symbolic sequence.

---

### **3. Symbolic â†’ Audio Rendering**

* Translate the symbolic music back into sound.
* Produce a playable audio waveform that captures the generated sequence.
* Result: a finished audio track from the original seed idea.

---

### **4. Interactive Demo Layer**

* Provide an interface for exploration.
* Users can upload a clip, watch its symbolic transformation, and hear the extended output.
* Designed for accessibility: no ML expertise required to try it out.

## High-Level Tech Stack Summary

* **Stage 1**: Audio abstraction into symbolic notes.
* **Stage 2**: Generative model trained on symbolic music corpora.
* **Stage 3**: Conversion back to audio domain.
* **Stage 4**: Lightweight interactive frontend + easy deployment.
